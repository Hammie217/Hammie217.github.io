<h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML (Hypertext Mark-up Language) is a programming language unlike your usual C or Java as this is designed purely for websites and graphical programming compared to Java which is used more for logic programming (aka doing automatic maths). This means you don’t have to set up a graphical window as that is already done for you, all you must do is program what goes on this page.<br /><br />For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, the third of Newtons laws is everywhere in physics and the same in programming, for every tag opened it must also be closed at the end, this  is done by simply adding a forward slash in the opening tag like this:<br />Opening tag <code>&lt;body&gt;</code><br />Closing tag <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code></p>
        <h2>Parent, Child relationship</h2>
        <p>In HTML your code is always tags within tags which gives you the relationship of what sections of the website go where, when a tag is within another aka how a &lt;p&gt; may be within &lt;body&gt; the p is said to be the child of the body class and therefore the body is the parent. It’s always useful to understand the language used by programmers otherwise when you look up new things to learn the language will confuse you and will make your job as a programmer massively harder</p>
        <h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>
        <p>In HTML, it is always advised to use what is called responsive web design, this means that when different machines load up the same website it should be just as easy to use. This is done by making sections of the webpage percentage based meaning so that for any monitor an image or section will always be 50% and not a set number of pixels. Some older websites haven’t used responsive web design due to when they were made there wasn’t really any need to but now if you loaded one of these websites up on a modern-day computer everything would be odd sizes and likely mixed up. So, make a note! Responsive web design = Good practice.</p>
        <h2>HTML Standards</h2>
        <p>HTML has standards that are followed so that code is readable all around the world, it is a very good idea to familiarise yourself with these W3C standards at https://www.w3.org/ . This website is also rather good as they have an automatic validation service where you can upload your HTML and see if it does pass these regulations.</p>

With this you have a basic table. You could enter titles as data but it is more accepted to use <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> standing for table headings, you can choose the scope to be column or row setting which it is a heading for.<br />You should generally define your data in the table in a <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>  and the heading in a <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> and footer in <code>&lt;tfoot&gt;</code><br />Borders are very common in tables and it is more accepted generally to use css which is done by:<pre>table, td{<br />border : 1px solid black;<br />}<br /></pre>Which creates a 1pixel black border for the table and each entry.</td>
