<p>Digital Multimedia broadcasting (DMB) is based on the Eureka 147 Digital Audio 
Broadcast (DAB) system which is widely deployed in the UK and many other 
countries around the world.  One of the advantages of using DMB is that it could 
be rolled out and used without much modification, simply increasing the level of 
error correction to cope with the mobile environment.</p>

<p>Eureka 147 allows for broadcasts from both terrestrial transmitters and satellite 
based transmitters.  For DMB both platforms are also possible, but in view of the 
differing transmission requirements between the two systems, some modifications 
would be needed.  For terrestrial based transmissions a flavour of the system 
designated as T-DMB (Terrestrial Digital Multimedia Broadcasting) is used, whereas 
for satellite broadcasting S-DMB (Satellite Digital Multimedia Broadcasting) is 
used.</p>

    <tr>
    <td><p>Like many other broadcasting systems, DMB and DAB use a form of transmission 
known as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM). This has been adopted 
because of its high data capacity and suitability for applications such as 
broadcasting. It also offers a high resilience to interference, can tolerate 
multi-path effects and is able to offer the possibility of a single frequency 
network, SFN.</p>

<p>Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) is a form of modulation which 
uses a large number of closely spaced carriers that are modulated with low rate 
data.  These signals would normally be expected to interfere with each other, but 
by making the signals orthogonal by choosing the carrier spacing carefully, 
interference can be avoided.  For this to occur, the carrier spacing must be 
equal to the reciprocal of the symbol period.  When a particular signal is demodulated, 
the adjacent carriers will contain a whole number of cycles in each symbol period 
and their contribution will sum to zero.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p align="center">
<img src="ofdm.gif" alt="OFDM Spectrum" height="112" width="300"></p>
<p align="center"><i>OFDM Spectrum</i></p>


<p>The data to be transmitted is split across all the carriers and this means that 
by using error correction techniques, if some of the carriers are lost due to 
multi-path effects, then the data can be reconstructed.  Additionally having data 
carried at a low rate across all the carriers means that the effects of 
reflections and inter-symbol interference can be overcome.  It also means that 
single frequency networks, where all transmitters can transmit on the same 
channel can be implemented. For more information on OFDM refer to

    <td><p>It would be possible to utilise the DAB transmission system within the UK, 
however much of the capacity has already been taken up, although some reserve capacity 
has been retained for future data transmissions of which DMB could be part.</p>

<p>A more likely solution is to use frequencies within the L-Band DAB allocation 
(1452 - 1467.5 MHz), which in some countries would require little legislation.</p>

<p>By using a new band it will not only be possible to use smaller antennas, an 
important element for mobile phones and PDAs, but it will also be possible to 
tailor the transmission to accommodate the Doppler shifts likely to be 
encountered by small mobile devices.  This can be achieved by reducing the number 
of carriers.  Despite the carrier number reduction, the maximum data rate of 
1.152 Mbps is still retained.  The drawback of using the L band frequencies is 
that they would require a much higher density of transmitters to provide the 
required coverage.</p>

    <td><p>One of the major requirements for any mobile video system is that it shall not 
place a major load on the battery of the handheld device.  With user expectations 
requiring that battery life shall be several days between recharges, this is a 
major consideration.  While battery technology is improving, and IC technology 
has enabled power consumption of chips to be reduced, basic technology can 
also play its part.</p>

<p>DAB inherently includes a technique known as time slicing by using a Time 
Division Multiplexing delivery method.  In this way the receiver is only switched 
on when it is required, thereby saving battery power.  This makes DMB (which is 
based on DAB) particular suited to the delivery of material to handheld devices.</p>
