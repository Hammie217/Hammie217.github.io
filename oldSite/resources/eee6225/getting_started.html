        and implement the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) on an FPGA board
        to meet some constraint (low area or high throughput).<br />
        <p>At the start of this exercise you are confronted with a large amount of
        information and the realisation that this is an opportunity to develop
        your skills in a number of areas and it may seem quite
        bewildering.&nbsp; Your immediate thoughts are likely to be:
      </p>
        <div style="margin-left: 80px;">What is the AES?<br />
How do I design digital circuits?<br />What is VHDL?<br /> Am I really expected to do this?<br />
Who is in my group?<br />What are we supposed to be doing?<br />
How do we get started?

    <tr>
      <td width="100%">It is essential to plan what you as a group are
going to do and regularly review the plan.&nbsp; Planning allows you to
be much more effective as a team.&nbsp; You need to start by breaking
down the "big scary" task into simpler tasks each with objectives,
dependencies and time-scales.&nbsp; It is good practice to assign
responsibility for a task to a member of the group, with an agreed
deadline for its completion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Larger tasks should be broken
down into stages (each being its own task) with a review process put in
place to guide overall delivery of a successful outcome for the larger
task.<br>
      <br>
NOTE: Planning itself is your first TASK and an ongoing one requiring
regular review!<br>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td >Digital design is a process and
follows the same method some may already be familiar with for
software.&nbsp; There are a number of distinct stages each followed by
a review and if necessary rework (which may include revisiting an
earlier step).<br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Requirements capture</strong>:
what the resulting <em>module</em>
should do from its users perspective (in plain language).<br>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Specification</strong>:
typically quantified detail (in engineering language) of what the
module must do and what is "nice to have".</li>
        <li><strong>Outline design</strong>:
using not too many words and ideally a diagram or picture and overview
of your solution.</li>
        <li><strong>Detail design</strong>: this
is where attention to detail is necessary and all the "what if..."
questions need answering.&nbsp; In doing so remember to document them
as they may form part of the testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing</strong>: this is
where you prove that your design does what is required by the
specification.&nbsp; Early detection of problems will reduce the cost
(your time!) to fix them.&nbsp; </li>
        <li><strong>Delivery</strong>: typically
a design is always part of a larger system and must be handed over to
someone else to integrate it into the bigger project.&nbsp; This will
certainly include documentation of what it does and how to check it
works.<br>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Critical review</strong>:
this is an essential part of engineering and how we as engineers can
improve our engineering decision making process.&nbsp; Ask yourself
questions like: How well was the task done?&nbsp; What could I have
done better?&nbsp; What have I learned in the process?&nbsp; What
should I make a note of to do differently next time?</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
NOTE: Design is hierarchical, there are many different levels all of
which have interfaces and interact with each other.&nbsp; Changes at
any one level can drastically effect other parts of the system.<br>
      <br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="tblue">4. Teamwork</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%">Teamwork is all about communication!&nbsp; As a
group you need to coordinate your efforts and consider how and what you
are doing will affect the other members of your group.&nbsp; You need
to consider what you need from other group members AND what they need
from you!<br>
      <br>
Early formulation of a clear plan and ensuring that changes to the plan
are discussed and communicated to all group members makes the overall
task much simpler.&nbsp; Continually reviewing your plan does <strong>not</strong> mean continually changing it,
once a plan is agreed <strong>stick to it</strong>
until you have fully considered the need for changing it. 

<p><strong>If you think you need to drastically change your plan during semester 2
discuss this with your demonstrators or academic staff first.</strong></p>
